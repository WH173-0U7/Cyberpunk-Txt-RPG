# Working on Night City Terminal

A browser game (TypeScript + Vite) set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, played mostly on phones.
The README covers how it plays and how the code is laid out.

## Content comes from the Cyberpunk Wiki

- **Canon first.** Names, places, districts, factions, corporations, history, slang and how
  systems work (the NCART, ripperdocs, braindance…) come from the Cyberpunk Wiki,
  https://cyberpunk.fandom.com. Use canon until it runs out; only then make something up,
  in the same style, and never reuse a real name for something made up.
- **Numbers are ours.** Prices, travel times, stats and other tuning are game design, not
  canon. They live in `src/data/` (travel and prices are in `src/data/travel.ts`).
- **Check before adding.** Confirm a name, its spelling and where it is (district and
  sub-district) on the wiki. Prefer the wiki's styling (e.g. "Night Corp", "BARGHEST").
- **Reading the wiki.** Its pages sit behind a bot check, but the MediaWiki API works:
  `https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&rvslots=main&redirects=1&format=json&formatversion=2&titles=A|B|C`
  (up to 50 titles per call). Keep requests few and send a descriptive User-Agent.
- **Write our own words.** Wiki text is CC BY-SA: take the facts, don't copy the sentences.
- **Images are reference only.** Wiki images are CD Projekt Red's art. Use them as a visual
  baseline for the look; don't add them to the repo or the game.

## Checks before a PR

```bash
npm test           # unit tests, including checks on hundreds of generated cities
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

- When a change makes seeds build different places (new content counts), bump
  `GENERATOR_VERSION` in `src/engine/generate.ts` and add the new fingerprint in
  `tests/save.test.ts`. The fingerprint test fails as a reminder.
- `TRAVEL.timeScale` in `src/data/travel.ts` is 60 while testing; 1 is real time.
- Merging to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages (https://wh173-0u7.github.io/Cyberpunk-Txt-RPG/).
